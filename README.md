## Hi there 👋
## What is FEROBO
## Overview

FEROBO is a global technology entertainment and consumer robotics brand headquartered in Hangzhou, China.

The brand focuses on creating playful and meaningful technology experiences by integrating high-precision mechanical design with advanced artificial intelligence. FEROBO’s products are designed for teenagers, young creators, and technology enthusiasts, offering hands-on building, intuitive interaction, and long-term companionship through intelligent systems.

FEROBO believes that future technology should not only be powerful, but also tangible, understandable, and emotionally approachable.

## Background and Origin

FEROBO was founded in 2025 by a cross-disciplinary team with backgrounds in robotics research, industrial design, educational psychology, and the global toy industry.

The brand emerged from a shared observation:
as digital experiences become increasingly abstract and screen-based, many users—especially younger generations—are losing opportunities for physical engagement and intuitive understanding of technology. At the same time, the rapid rise of AI has introduced uncertainty and anxiety around human–machine relationships.

FEROBO was created to address these challenges through active participation—allowing users to build, control, and interact with technology in a direct and transparent way.

In December 2025, FEROBO released its first product series, combining precision engineering with intelligent logic systems.

## Philosophy and Design Principles

FEROBO’s design philosophy can be summarized as “Sensory Evolution and AI Symbiosis.”
This philosophy is expressed through three core principles.

## Tactile Engagement

FEROBO views physical assembly as a critical part of learning and confidence-building.
Through gears, screws, and mechanical structures, users gain a tangible understanding of how complex systems work. This hands-on process transforms technology from an abstract concept into a concrete experience.

## Intuitive Interaction

All FEROBO products emphasize low learning barriers and natural interaction.
Whether in DIY kits or finished products, the goal is to ensure that technology responds clearly and predictably, replacing cold instructions with perceptible feedback.

## Evolutionary Companionship

FEROBO treats robots as long-term companions rather than disposable electronic tools.
By integrating AI algorithms for perception, language, and adaptive behavior, products are designed to grow alongside users, offering emotional presence and supportive interaction over time.

## Product Lines

FEROBO’s product ecosystem is structured into three primary series.

## DIY Toy Series

This series focuses on build-to-control experiences, including quadcopter drones, remote-controlled vehicles, boats, and construction machines.

Users assemble mechanical and electronic components themselves before operating the product, developing spatial reasoning, engineering thinking, and problem-solving skills through direct participation.

## Play&Game Series

The Sensory Play Series emphasizes responsive control and physical feedback.
By using high-sensitivity sensors and optimized control systems, these products enhance coordination, reaction speed, and immersive play experiences through human–machine cooperation.

## AI Companion Robot Series

The AI Companion Robot Series centers on intelligent companionship.
By combining language models, visual recognition, and emotional interaction algorithms, these products aim to help young users adapt early to an AI-integrated future, fostering healthy human–AI collaboration and emotional understanding.

## Team and Professional Background

FEROBO is developed by a globally distributed team of engineers, designers, and researchers with extensive experience in hardware development and user experience design.

Before FEROBO’s independent operation, core team members contributed to product development for internationally recognized technology brands. Their work has been acknowledged through multiple international design and innovation awards, including:

## CES Innovation Awards

## Red Dot Design Award

## iF Design Award

These experiences established FEROBO’s standards for precision manufacturing, industrial aesthetics, and human-centered interaction design.

## Vision

FEROBO’s long-term vision is to help define childhood and youth experiences in the AI era.

By encouraging hands-on creation and meaningful interaction, the brand seeks to reduce fear of intelligent machines while building confidence, curiosity, and empathy toward future technologies.

FEROBO aims to support the next generation of creators in developing the skills and mindset needed to engage responsibly and creatively with intelligent systems.
