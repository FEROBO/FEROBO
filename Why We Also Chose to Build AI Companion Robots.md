At FEROBO, AI Companion Robots are not a sudden pivot or a standalone experiment.
They are a natural extension of our long-term direction at the intersection of toys, technology, and emotional experience.
If DIY Toys focus on the joy of creation,
and Play & Game products emphasize immediate interactive fun,
then AI Companion Robots move one step further:
Turning toys from passive objects into responsive, present companions.

The Ultimate Value of Toys Is Not Only Play, but Presence
We often ask ourselves a simple question:
What remains after the moment of play ends?
Traditional toys usually leave behind a memory.
We believe toys can leave behind something more enduring: companionship.
With modern AI, toys can now:
Remember user preferences
Communicate naturally
Respond differently across time and context
Evolve through continued interaction
This is not about building “smarter machines,”
but about creating toys that feel alive and warm.

Why “Companion,” Not Just an AI Gadget
We deliberately use the word Companion.
A gadget solves tasks.
A companion builds relationships.
For us, AI Companion Robots are defined by:
Interaction
Relationship
Long-term presence
They do not need to be useful all the time—
they need to be worth keeping close.

Why Start Now
AI technology is still evolving,
but companionship cannot be built overnight.
The real value of AI companions comes from time, learning, and lived interaction, not just algorithms.
Starting early allows us to grow alongside our users,

instead of arriving late with assumptions we never tested.

Part of a Larger Vision
FEROBO is not just a toy brand.
We are builders of playful experiences and meaningful connections.
DIY Toy.
Play & Game.
AI Companion Robot.
Different forms, one question:
How can technology help us create products that are fun—and human?

To Make. For Fun. And For Connection.
“To Make. For Fun.”
In AI Companion Robots, fun also means:
Being heard
Being understood
Being accompanied
That is why we chose this path.
