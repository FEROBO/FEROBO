## Introduction

At FEROBO, DIY toys are not treated as a category trend or a nostalgic return to traditional toys.
They represent a deliberate design decision rooted in how we believe people—especially younger generations—should engage with technology in the AI era.

DIY toys are the foundation of FEROBO’s product system, not an accessory to it.

The Problem We Observed

Modern technology consumption has become increasingly abstract.

Users interact with complex systems primarily through screens, touch panels, and voice commands, while the underlying mechanical and logical structures remain invisible. This abstraction has led to two growing issues:

Loss of tactile understanding — technology is used, but rarely understood.

Psychological distance from intelligent systems — AI is perceived as opaque, uncontrollable, or intimidating.

For younger users in particular, this creates a gap between technological dependence and technological confidence.

DIY as Active Participation

FEROBO approaches DIY toys as a form of active participation, not passive assembly.

By building a product from mechanical components, users are exposed to:

Physical cause-and-effect relationships

Structural logic and spatial reasoning

The discipline of step-by-step problem solving

Assembly is not a preliminary step before “real play.”
It is the first layer of interaction.

Through hands-on construction, technology becomes explainable, predictable, and approachable.

Build-to-Control: A Core Design Principle

FEROBO’s DIY products follow a Build-to-Control philosophy.

Users assemble the structure first, then operate the system they helped create. This sequence is intentional:

Control is earned through understanding

Operation is grounded in physical awareness

Confidence grows from knowing how things work, not just how to use them

This principle applies across drones, vehicles, construction machines, and future DIY-based systems.

Preparing Users for an AI-Integrated Future

DIY toys play a critical role in preparing users for more advanced interaction with intelligent systems.

Before engaging with AI-driven companionship or adaptive behaviors, users benefit from first understanding:

How mechanical systems respond

How inputs translate into outputs

How structure influences behavior

DIY serves as a cognitive bridge between physical engineering and intelligent interaction.

It helps reduce fear of complexity and builds a foundation for healthy human–AI collaboration.

Why DIY Comes First at FEROBO

FEROBO places DIY toys at the core of its product ecosystem for three reasons:

They restore physical engagement in a digital-first world

They build technological confidence through understanding, not abstraction

They establish a learning path toward more advanced AI-enabled experiences

DIY toys are not a limitation of technology.
They are a starting point for deeper interaction.

Conclusion

At FEROBO, DIY toys represent more than a product line.
They define how we believe technology should be introduced, understood, and trusted.

By allowing users to build before they control, and understand before they interact, DIY toys form the foundation of FEROBO’s long-term vision for playful, responsible, and human-centered technology.
